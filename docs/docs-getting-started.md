# Getting Started with Steering Files

## What You're Looking At

You've found a professional development framework built for **Kiro IDE**. These are steering files—specialized prompts that transform how you work with AI to level up your engineering skills.

Think of them as **"team leads in a file"** that make you think like senior developers.

---

## Is This For You?

**YES, if you:**
- Want to become a senior developer
- Need help thinking through complex projects
- Want guidance on architecture, testing, deployment
- Learn best by understanding the "why"
- Are serious about professional code quality

**MAYBE, if you:**
- Just want quick answers (these go deeper)
- Prefer working alone without guidance (these guide you)

**PROBABLY NOT, if you:**
- Just want to copy-paste code
- Don't care about best practices
- Are building throwaway projects

---

## What's Inside

### **8 Core Modes** (for specific situations)

Use these when you need expert thinking in that area:

1. **Architecture & System Design** - Planning big things
2. **Code Review & Quality** - Making code production-ready  
3. **Debugging & Troubleshooting** - Finding root cause systematically
4. **Research & Investigation** - Learning deeply and rigorously
5. **Testing & Reliability** - Strategic test planning
6. **Performance Optimization** - Measuring and optimizing right
7. **DevOps & Deployment** - Shipping safely and reliably
8. **Technical Debt & Refactoring** - Managing code health

### **1 Project Mode** (for full projects)

Load this when starting a brand new project. It guides you through all 10 phases from idea to shipped code.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Open Kiro IDE**
2. **Start a new chat**
3. **Type one of these:**
   ```
   #steering-architecture.md
   I need help designing a new system
   ```
   or
   ```
   #steering-project-full-lifecycle.md
   I'm starting a new project and want guidance
   ```
4. **Kiro loads the file and adapts**
5. **You get expert guidance**

---

## How It Works

**Traditional prompt engineering:** You write a long prompt, AI responds once, you get what you get.

**Steering files:** 
1. You load a specialized file once
2. Kiro reads it for the entire conversation
3. Kiro thinks and responds through that lens for everything you ask
4. It's like having a domain expert in the chat with you

Example:
- Without steering: "How should I structure my database?"
- With `#steering-architecture.md`: "Here are three approaches with trade-offs. Which makes sense for your constraints? Let me challenge your thinking..."

---

## Real Examples

### Before Steering File
```
You: How do I test my React component?
AI: Here's a simple example...
```

### With Testing Steering File
```
You: Load #steering-testing.md. How should I test my React component?
AI: Before tests, let's talk strategy.
   - What business logic matters most?
   - What failures would hurt users?
   - What's your coverage target?
   Then we can discuss implementation...
```

See the difference? The steering file changes how the AI thinks.

---

## The Philosophy

These files teach you to **think like senior engineers**, not just follow recipes.

**Senior engineers don't:**
- Jump to code immediately
- Optimize without measuring
- Deploy without monitoring
- Skip difficult design decisions

**Senior engineers DO:**
- Think systematically
- Challenge assumptions
- Plan before coding
- Measure everything

These files encode that thinking.

---

## What Happens When You Use Them

You'll notice Kiro will:

✅ Ask clarifying questions before giving answers  
✅ Push you to think through trade-offs  
✅ Reference best practices and standards  
✅ Challenge vague or incomplete thinking  
✅ Teach you patterns and principles  
✅ Make you explain your decisions  

**That's intentional.** That's the learning happening.

---

## The Commitment

Using these well requires:

- **Time to think** - Not quick answers, deep understanding
- **Openness to challenge** - Kiro will question your assumptions
- **Following the discipline** - TDD, design-first, testing, documentation
- **Building projects** - These are meant for real work, not theory

**Payoff:** You level up faster than you ever have.

---

## Your Next Steps

1. **Read** `what-are-steering-files.md` to understand the philosophy
2. **Read** `how-to-use-steering-files.md` for practical usage patterns
3. **Read** `kiro-integration-guide.md` for Kiro-specific setup
4. **Look at** `project-full-lifecycle-example.md` to see it in action
5. **Start with one mode** on a real problem you're solving

## FAQ (Quick Version)

**Q: Can I use these without Kiro?**  
A: Yes! Use them as reference guides. But they work best with Kiro.

**Q: Do I need to use all 8 modes?**  
A: No. Use the ones relevant to what you're doing.

**Q: How long does this take?**  
A: Depends on your project. Project mode might take weeks as you build. Individual modes take minutes to hours.

**Q: Will this actually make me better?**  
A: Only if you use them to build real projects and actually think through what you're doing.

## Ready?

Pick one of these next:

- **To understand the concept:** Read `what-are-steering-files.md`
- **To start using them:** Read `how-to-use-steering-files.md`
- **To see an example:** Look at `project-full-lifecycle-example.md`
- **To start a project:** Load `#steering-project-full-lifecycle.md` in Kiro

You've got this. Let's go.
